I think everything typed made a lot of sense. However, think on this, what if you added a little content?
I am not suggesting your content isn't solid., but suppose you added a post title that
grabbed people's attention? I mean Emacs: One year later | Aaron Meurer's SymPy Blog is a little vanilla.
You should glance at Yahoo's front page and
see how they create post headlines to grab people interested.

You might try adding a video or a picture or two to grab people excited about
everything've written. Just my opinion, it would
make your blog a little livelier.
